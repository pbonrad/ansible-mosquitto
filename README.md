# ansible-mosquitto [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pbonrad/ansible-mosquitto.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pbonrad/ansible-mosquitto)

Mosquittoâ„¢ is an open source (EPL/EDL licensed) message broker that implements the MQTT protocol versions 3.1 and 3.1.1. MQTT provides a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it suitable for "Internet of Things" messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers like the Arduino.

This role installs Mosquitto on the target server using the `apt-get` package manager. It works for Ubuntu and Debian servers and was tested with the help of docker containers. In comparison to other Ansible role tests where Ansible runs inside the container and is connecting to localhost, I decided to use the [Ansible docker connection](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html#non-ssh-connection-types) (`ansible_connection=docker`). The build which run at [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/pbonrad/ansible-mosquitto) uses this functionality.

## Role Variables

A complete configuration file (which is quite long) can be found on the GitHub project:
[https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/blob/master/mosquitto.conf](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/blob/master/mosquitto.conf)

Actually I decided to use only a very limited number of basic configuration options to use in this role. The chosen entries are exact the same as are set while a default installation. I will extend it as soon as I or someone else needs more options.

## Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other roles. If you want to run the test, you need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Example Playbook

An example playbook is included in the `test.yml` file. You can use `run.sh` for running a test locally, which starts a docker container as the target.

    - hosts: all
      roles:
         - role: ansible-mosquitto
